[Vue warn]: Property    vue@next:1254
"total" was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.
at <App>


Melissa's Answer:

This Vue warning means that you declared a variable in the template area (the div area with the "app id") but that variable is not:
  - defined in the Vue area (the script where you put 'createApp')
  - you have a typo when you tried to use it in the Vue area
  - you didn't put the variable mentioned in the error in the 'return' part of the app (Vue area)


You cannot ignore this error. The code is not complete and will not work without declaring the variable in the Vue area.

To fix it, declare the variable in the createApp Vue area, correct the typo, or put the variable in the 'return' part of the createApp. In this example, you have
to declare the 'total' property.
